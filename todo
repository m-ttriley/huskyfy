front end:
    map with buttons that toggle which data is grabbed from db
    buttons based on buildings
    each building has api endpoint
    displays:
        -map
        -spotify playlist
        -adding a song prompt / deleting a song

back end:
    api endpoints
    endpoints based on buildings
    parse get requests from front end to get building id
    filter mongo results based on building id



order of todo:
1) simple A/B spotify playlist changer with dummy JSON data
2) setting up endpoints / receving building ID
3) filtering DB results
4) front end design
